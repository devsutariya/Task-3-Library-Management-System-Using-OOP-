# 📚 Library Management System (Java - OOP)

This is a console-based **Library Management System** developed in Java as part of a Java Developer Internship Task 3. It demonstrates core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Add and display books in the library
- Track book availability (Issued / Available)
- Register and manage users (name and user ID)
- Issue books to users
- Only allow return by the user who issued the book
- Prevent re-issuing an already issued book

---

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Applied

- **Class & Object**: Defined `Book`, `User`, and `Library` as separate classes
- **Encapsulation**: Private fields with public getters/setters
- **Abstraction**: Simplified interaction through public methods
- **Polymorphism**: Overriding `toString()` method
- **Association (HAS-A)**: Library *has* books, Book *has* a User

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 8+)
- VS Code / IntelliJ / Any IDE
- Terminal / Command Prompt

## 🗃️ File Structure


> A single file containing all classes: `Book`, `User`, `Library`, and `Main` (entry point).

## 🖥️ How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the `Main.java` file
2. Open terminal in the project folder
